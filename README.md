### Description
It contains my work for some coding problems:
* main.py: the problems come from the "Python Code Challenges" by Barron Stone on LinkedIn Learning
* Disjoint_Set.py: implements disjoint set data structure in Python to solve the Friend Circle Querries on HackerRank.
* MinStack.py: implements stack data structures with min() function that returns the min element of the stack in O(1), in addition to push(), pop() and peak().
